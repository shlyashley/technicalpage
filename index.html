                <article>
                    <p>CHI stands for: Cationic Hydration Interlink, which is a positively charged molecule that provides
moisture and links into the hair fiber.The silk and protein bonds are Cationic (positively charged) to penetrate into the
negative areas within the hair to build strength and resilience.
 </p>
                    <p>CHI is created under the Farouk Systems Group, that has the most innovative technology to hydrolyze the silk in liquid form or grind the Silk into a powder form.</p>

                    <p>Always test in 3 different places (back, sides and front):</p>

                            <li><b>Check the elasticity of the hair.</b></li>

                                    <li>Take a small strand of hair between your fingers and gently pull in outward direction. You should feel the hair return back like an elastic band.</li>

                                    <li>By using a water spray bottle, remove product from strand and check the formation against palm of your hand.</li>
                                    <li>Important! You are not looking for perfectly straight hair at this point.</li>
                                    <li>When desired transformation has been achieved, hair is ready for intermediate rinsing.</li>

                    <p><b>Check the results every 3 minutes!</b></p> 
                    <p>Timing is always approximate. But <b>DO NOT</b> exceed processing times! To accelerate processing time, low heat may be used with <b><u>Formula A and B</u></b> of the CHI Transformation Phase One Solution. Cool for 5 minutes if heat is used. <b>DO NOT</b> use heat with <b><u>Formula C.</u></b> Keep in mind the texture, condition and the porosity of the hair. Use your professional judgment! <code>(Always strand test prior to service).</code></p>
